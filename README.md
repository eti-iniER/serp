# Group 28 - CSC 310 Project

This project was created as a requirement for the course **CSC 310 - Concurrency in Java**.

We were asked (using any programming language) to implement a multi-threaded program to crawl the internet and find relevant information, and return the information in a useful and understandable format. We were also asked to visualize the information in a meaningful way.

We chose to do this using Python, and the following libraries:

-   **scrapy:** For web scraping
-   **threading:** To handle multi-threading
-   **matplotlib:** For visualisation
